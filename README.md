# OwlPy
A bunch of scripts easing out the Owl/TensorFlow workflow. Very Alpha.

## Deployment
As this library is currently very under construction, I'm not even trying to put the code in packages. Treat is as a snippet repo.

## What
This project is a bunch of helper functions which I'm developing for the fluent Owl/.NET/Python/Accord/TensorFlow pipeline.
